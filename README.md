# Food delivery management system
 
The goal of this project was to do system analysis and design for an online food delivery company (FoodBox) and come up with UML diagrams for helping the company understand it's requirement.

### Description about the company business website
FoodBox is an online business that serves many customers by allowing them to order food for delivery from local restaurants. The company has a web portal that has a listing of local restaurants for a zip code. The restaurants will be able to register with the portal and list their menus for an annual subscription fee of $190 or a monthly subscription fee of $25. Drivers, who are willing to pick up food from restaurants and deliver to customers will be able to register with the portal for an annual subscription fee of $95 or a monthly subscription fee of $15. Customers will be able to search for restaurants based on the zip code and view a list of all restaurants registered with FoodBox around that area. They will be able to view the menu for a particular restaurant and place an order. The payment is complete when the order is placed. Once an order is placed, the restaurant can either accept or reject the order. If an order is rejected, the customer must be refunded for the payment made. If an order is accepted by the restaurant, the restaurant provides an estimated time in the portal when the order will be ready for pickup. The application searches for drivers who are near the restaurant and available to deliver the food and notifies the selected driver to drive to the restaurant at the time when the order is expected to be ready for pickup. The driver is also provided with the address of the customer to whom the delivery needs to be made. The portal also provides a way for users to register for an account with the system, track their orders, view their order history and process a payment using credit card, paypal or zelle. 

### What to install
we need to install visio professional for building UML diagrams, for UTD students it's free.

### What we will be doing
* build a Use Case Diagram
* identify Major Classes along with it's attributes and operations
* build a class diagram
* build a sequence diagram

### Approach
* First read through the company's description to understand what it does and whom are they interacting with.
* Identify actors(eg: driver, customer) and use cases (eg: placing order, etc), get relation between usecase and build Use case diagram. check out this [Link](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/use-case-diagrams.html).
* Identify major classes and build class diagram. for reference check this [link](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/uml-class-diagram-tutorial/)
* finally, with the help of usecase description build sequence diagram.
